Refactor quorum to make it possible to use either their custom consensus
mechanism or PoW by a command-line switch.


= Issues running/testing =

- After running setup.py develop I get rlp0.4.7, but devp2p requires <=0.4.6,
  so installed 0.4.6 manually

- On Ubuntu, the flake8 package is for python3, so it reports lots of errors

- pytest is not in requirements.txt
  maybe need a dev_requirements.txt?

- $ pyethapp --profile testnet run
  missing deps: pycryptodome>=3.3.1, bitcoin, tox, secp256k1==0.12.1,
docutils>=0.3, backports.shutil_get_terminal_size, traitlets,
simplegeneric>0.8, pickleshare, pyethash, pysha3, repoze.lru, ptyprocess>=0.5,
greenlet>=0.4.9

- in setup.py we have tests_require=[ethereum-serpent>=1.8.1], and
  because of that it's impossible to run tests manually. After installing it
  manually I was able to execute the tests by simply running 'pytest'

- 'pytest -k test_logfilters_topics' to run a single test

- 'pytest pyethapp/tests/test_jsonrpc.py' to run only tests in that file
